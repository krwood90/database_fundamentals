1.  List the commands for adding, updating, and deleting data
        The commands are:
                Create Table, Insert into
                Update, Alter Table
                Delete From, Delete Table



2.  Explain the structure for each type of command.
        For adding a value
                INSERT INTO table (column, column, ...)
                Values
                (aaa, 'bbb', ...)
                (aaa, 'bbb', ...)
                (aaa, 'bbb', ...);
        For updating the table
                UPDATE table SET value WHERE column=value;
        For deleting the values
                DELETE FROM table WHERE column=value;
        For altering the tables
                ALTER TABLE table ADD/DROP COLUMN column data type;
                DROP TABLE table;



3.  What are some the data types that can be used in tables? Give a real world example of each.
        Some data types that canbe used in tables are timestamp(to know when something was made), numeric or money(to be able to place decimals for money), character (to limit the amount of letters used to limit space).



4.  Think through how to create a new table to hold a list of people invited to a wedding. This table needs to have first and last name, whether they sent in their RSVP, the number of guests they are bringing, and the number of meals (1 for adults and 1/2 for children).
        - Which data type would you use to store each of the following pieces of information?
            - First and last name.
                use text
            - Whether they sent in their RSVP.
                use boolean
            - Number of guests.
                use integer
            - Number of meals.
                use numeric
        - Write a command that makes the table to track the wedding.
                CREATE TABLE wedding (
                        id integer,
                        name text,
                        RSVP boolean,
                        guests integer,
                        meals numeric(5, 1)
                );
        - Using the table we just created, write a command that adds a column to track whether they were sent a thank you card.
                ALTER TABLE wedding ADD COLUMN card boolean;
        - You have decided to move the data about the meals to another table, so write a command to remove the column storing the number meals from the wedding table.
                ALTER TABLE wedding DROP COLUMN meals;
        - The guests are going to need a place to sit at the reception, so write a command that adds a column for table number.
                ALTER TABLE wedding ADD COLUMN tableNumber integer;
        - The wedding is over and we do not need to keep this information, so write a command that deletes the wedding table from the database.
                DROP TABLE wedding;



5.  Write a command to make a new table to hold the books in a library with the columns ISBN, title, author, genre, publishing date, number of copies, and available copies.
                CREATE TABLE library (
                        ISBN integer,
                        title text,
                        author text,
                        genre text,
                        publishingDate date,
                        numberOfCopies integer,
                        availableCopies integer
                );
        - Find three books and add their information to the table.
                INSERT INTO library (ISBN, title, author, genre, publishingDate, numberOfCopies, availableCopies)
                VALUES
                (154687, 'Todo', 'John Michaels', 'Fiction', 1992-03-25, 543, 23),
                (154688, 'Robin', 'Michael Grouess', 'Non-Fiction', 1975-08-15, 841, 81),
                (154689, 'Buddy', 'Charlie Fevoul', 'Fiction', 2007-12-08, 243, 38);
        - Someone has just checked out one of the books. Change the available copies column to 1 fewer.
                UPDATE library SET availableCopies=80 WHERE ISBN=154688;
        - Now one of the books has been added to the banned books list. Remove it from the table.
                DELETE FROM library WHERE ISBN=154687;



6.  Write a command to make a new table to hold spacecrafts. Information should include id, name, year launched, country of origin, a brief description of the mission, orbiting body, if it is currently operating, and approximate miles from Earth. In addition to the table creation, provide commands that perform the following operations:
                CREATE TABLE spacecrafts(
                        id integer,
                        name text,
                        yearLaunched integer,
                        countryOforigin text,
                        description text,
                        orbitingBody text,
                        operating boolean,
                        milesFromEarth bigint,
                );
        - Add 3 non-Earth-orbiting satellites to the table.
                INSERT INTO spacecrafts(id, name, yearLaunched, countryOforigin, description, orbitingBody, operating, milesFromEarth)
                VALUES
                (1, 'Falcon1', 1993, 'New Zealand', 'First spaceship ever made by the kiwis', 'cone', true, 25440123),
                (2, 'Eagle1', 2004, 'Puerto Rico', 'How can this thing even fly', 'square', true, 3829102344),
                (3, 'Raven4', 1971, 'Cambodia', 'Still a secret', 'Sphere', true, 382817731023);
        - Remove one of the satellites from the table since it has just been crashed into the planet.
                DELETE FROM spacecrafts WHERE id=2;
        - Edit another satellite because it is no longer operating and change the value to reflect that.
                UPDATE spacecrafts SET operating=false WHERE id=3;



7.  Write a command to make a new table to hold the emails in your inbox. This table should include an id, the subject line, the sender, any additional recipients, the body of the email, the timestamp, whether or not it’s been read, and the id of the email chain it’s in. Also provide commands that perform the following operations:
                CRATE TABLE emails(
                        id integer,
                        subjectLine text,
                        sender text,
                        additionalRecipients text,
                        body text,
                        time timestamp,
                        read boolean,
                        chainId integer,
                );
        - Add 3 new emails to the inbox.
                INSERT INTO emails(id, subjectLine, sender, additionalRecipients, body, time, read, chainId)
                VALUES
                (1, 'class', 'addi@state.edu', 'none', 'Hey you have the notes from class?', timestamp, true, 1)
                (2, 'work', 'michi@boring.com', 'viks@boring.com, bunggeeeee@boring.com', 'Who is the one that broke the fridge in the kitchen?', timestamp, true, 4)
                (3, 'stupid stuff', 'blabber@blog.com', 'flaffa@blog.com, duft@blog.com', 'Need to checkout this video asap, so funny!!', timestamp, true, 2)
        - You’ve just deleted one of the emails, so write a command to remove the row from the inbox table.
                DELETE FROM emails WHERE id=1;
        - You started reading an email but just heard a crash in another room. Mark the email as unread before investigating, so you can come back to it later.
                UPDATE emails SET read=false WHERE id=3;
